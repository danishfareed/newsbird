# Welcome to News Bird

This is one of my react project, which simply fetch the data from the news API.
Due to API limitations, I wasn't able to host this app, it's **offline!** and runs smoothly on local host.

## API Used

https://newsapi.org/ 
For documentation please refer: https://newsapi.org/docs

To make this app work for you, you've to add your own api key, which you can get from newsapi.org

You can paste this api key in **.env.local** file.
